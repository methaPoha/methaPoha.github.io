            There's always someone in between, competition hi itna high hai, and having low self esteem isn't helping either. Ab bas dekh hi sakta hu. Lagta hai peak meltdown hone wala hai mera. <br>
            jo bhi ho, i'm always happy from outside. Everyone's life is a roller coaster, even his. He recently had a bad car accident involving his family, everything is fine now, but at a time it was not. <em class="gold">Respect</em>, from both side.</p>

            Har gaya mai shayad. It seems imposible now, mere standard aur uske standard me bahoot difference hai. Bahoot time lag gaya yeh samjhne me. <br>
            khud ka bar raise karna is an only option i see, lekin isme time lagega, yeh tab tak toh nahi ho raha jab tak mai hostel me hu. Lekin tab tak bahot late hojayega, feb me jyada din nahi. Long story short, i lost the only game which i had chance to play. maybe it's the end, who knowns, answers are encrypted. And this, doesn't sparks joy. good for them. <br>
            peace out, anger inside. <br>

            Still don't get the reason behind valentines day, i mean you've got 365 days to express your love, but you are gonna do it only in these 2 week. huh!? makes no sense to me. maybe because i don't have anyone to show love to.

And second of all, she talked for about 3hrs, damn. Missed 2 lectures and came back. Also heard her use word <em class="glow">bhai</em> and now i am overthinking, that she was talking to her boyfriend. lame me. <br>
