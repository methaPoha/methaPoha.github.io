        <h2>Caught in 4k</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>not really in 4k, there was a window between us.</p>
            <p>
                I didn't catch her, she tied a knot on my hook. Like crazy bro, lights are on and she's turning lighter like crazy. also knock on my windows, what am I supposed to do? Light the ciggy for you? <br>
                Idk if anyone in the family knows about this. Delhi girls man. For them it's like 1 i-pill a day keeps the doctor away, iykyk. I could blackmail her, but I don't think that's going to work out, little me~delhi in her. 
            </p>
            <p class="context">a bit of context, My grandmother died 2 days back, and i'm here for puja and rituals that happens. I'm sleeping on first floor with 2 other. I'm alone in my room and there's a balcony beside my room. My sis, aparently, comes to balcony to smoke weed everyday.</p>
            <p>One <a href="#notciggy">ciggy</a> lasts 2 min, and she was coughing the first time this happened. Hmm, evidence ig. Says she brought some from Delhi. Delhi is the hub man.</p>

            <p>All this, again, makes me retrospect my belief. Is being good good?<br><img src="sincommit.png" alt="a random quote"><br>Does sin cancel out sin, if yes then i'm yet to commit a sin.</p>

            <p><em class="context">Edit: 2025-02-06</em><br>
                I'm gonna lose track at one point, <br>
                6: 00:47am <br>
                7: 00:03am
            <br><br> Also, someone posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1iheik4/caught_my_elder_sister22_smoking/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">this</a> WHILE I'm here in dhanbad. The exact situation I'm in. lmfao, small world ig.</p>

            <p><em class="context">Edit: 2025-02-07</em><br>
                I used to, and still, associate smoking with low iq. <a href="https://x.com/dbs_10_10/status/1886385627505017326">..</a>
            </p>
            <p id="notciggy" class="highlight">
                She certainly doesn't smoke ciggy, I think it's marijuana, still not sure. I have smelled any hard smoke, light smoke, white smoke. Can't be ciggy. I think she's got a smoking pipe and some marijuana. <a href="#miracle">miracle</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Guessing she talks to her male friend. And it took crazy turn today(7feb), topic shifted to vibrator :flush:. I was all ready for it :yea_boi: :iykyk:, but 2 sec later she said 'okay bye' and lol it was over. Smoked for like 12min from my recordings. Yeah i'm tryin' to record her talk from yesterday(freaky me), will attach them at last..
            </p>
            <p id="miracle" class="highlight">
                Yo wtf just happened, this never happened before. She came back. Like I was all ready and geared up to start working on my site and she came back, shit, real shit. I had to quickly get back to being quiet again. This bed makes loud noises and I can't even move my hand, or she'll get to know I am awake and eavesdropping on her. This time the talks got even crazier. He(whom my cousin is talking to), ig, is a weed dealer, and was showing his weed to her. AND they started talking about how painful it is taking in ass. That's when my sister ran up to the roof, so no idea what happened then. I'm pretty sure, he got live nudes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lol, what I assume to be a single para life update, turned into a 500 word essay. Imagine her reading this. No way she's a virgin, SoDe & Goa girl. Her brother lives abroad and is rocking hoes too, & masi's son earning 7 figures. I'm falling behind, and having this introverted vibes isn't helping. Work on yourself, you gotta find girls too. shit.

                Today's my last day here, the train's at 5. Was here for a week or so, never talked to her. We used to chill so much together back in 2015-2012, we were good. But i(for sure) fell off, we didn't even exchange a proper sentence, like strangers. When I was taking a group photo of us with family, she came in shorts and asked me not to take her feet in the pic. Lol, what does she think man :rofl:, I'm not gonna upload your feet pic online. But, just in case, if you(the readers) ever happen to be in a situation where you need feet pics, just send email on the address given in the footer. <br><img src="chadgpt.png" alt="random chatgpt screen, from where sun shines">

            <p>
                Anyways, I'm done with this for now. λ|&lt;|&lt;4N¢н4, if you are reading this, would love to spend some time like it's 2012. I'm just as freaky as you, just a little shy. A bj wouldn't hurt, yk. hehe.

            <p><em class="context">conclusion</em><br>
                Also this is also how I confirmed that I'm heterosexual. Recently I saw some reddit post, which(knowing how easy it is too brainwash me) made me doubt my sexuality. I equally enjoy both Lesbian & gay(ofc straight porn too). <br>
                When at night my sis would come, i would get cozy and fall asleep in a few min, listening her voice, whereas it would take me hours of laying on bed to sleep. And also came as 1 on kinsey scale. Hence, i'm Hetro, as of 09 Feb 2025.

            <p class="glow">Not yet masturbated, will come back here when on PNC.</p>

            <p><em class="context">Edit: 2025-02-17</em><br>
                while she's smoking weed, i'm filling my room with mosquito coils smoke.
            </p>

            <p><em class="context">Edit: 2025-04-16</em><br>
                Ah shit, here we meet again.
            </p>

            <p><em class="context">Edit: 2025-04-17</em><br>
                Unlike last time, we are talking this time.
