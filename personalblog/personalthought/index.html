                ngl, sometimes K.S. feels like he is just using us as a catapult. <br>
                I fear betrayal coming from his side soon. <br>
                The way he licks vedansh's ass, and then says seniors are bad. Something's for sure fissy. I can't read his mind, but his actions are sus, very sus.
                <br>
                <em class="context">Context: Vedansh, as a elected mentor & senior of AIADS batch, is organising a fresher party. &(apparently) is forcing us to pay the fees & attend it. Between all this, we had technovision25 at SATI, and he allegedly was supporting day scholar get qualified & making (us)hostler get eliminated. Including me, we too had a great fight with flux team. didn't knew vedansh was behind this. All of us hostler are now against vendash cum bucket, but koustubh is still licking. while most of our batch are making excuses to not attend freshers party, koustubh is going. Knowing how badly vedansh abused his floormates, one of them got seisures and was in hospital for few days.</em>

                Thinking more about this, how we forgot R.G. Kar case in weeks, tell a lot about what mindset of people i/we are living with. Teasing females is so normalized, that even girls straight up asks for it(credits to... instagram). Some neighbor told be not go vidisha for uni, we were like fucj'em, we ball. people so shit here, walking in torn cloths here feels like i'm some rich frag. apart from that, how dangerous it is for females. no way i'm sending my sister in this college. All of seniors are like crazy dipped towards getting pussy, damn, how sexually deprived you have to be for this level of nichness. <br>

                <s>Country</s> government is doomed fr man. No one is there to impose law, just pay and escape. money is the real deal now and one with it are doing the above. <br>
                what can i say man. some of the peers i'm living with talks about naked women & rap<s>e</s> all day. Plays with knife and glass shards, throws at everyone he sees. but again, who's there to stop them. I can't speak anything, I got 4 years to survive, but yeah this is the currrent state of our country and going down. doomed fr. <br>
                I too gotta get job somewhere, but seeing news like this, someone breaking bikes in gurgao, pollution & traffic in cities demotes me. <br>
                motivates me to get job in a india's rival country like china. <br>
                out of all the criminal activities that can be done, breaking youth's trust is the worst. and for sure india will see it's effect soon, when all of youth will leave for better. <br>
                yeah, gov can stop this from happening by not giving you money. work hard, get job, get experience, still no money. This is india i'm waiting for.

                It's crazy how facebook was once at peak, everyone was uploading pic of themselves & their family without thinking about digital footprint. <br>
                People switched away from facebook, but media still exists and can be viewed by anyone with internet access. <br>
                uploading is your ownn pick is find, but for god sake, stop upoading your child's nude. <br><br>

                Life's been rollercoaster lately. e-cell join toh kar liya, lekin lauda kuch malum hai. + sare batch-in wale senior ragging lete. second meet me dance bhi karwa liya :save_me:. Let's see how long i survive, lagta nahi mai tik bhi paunga. <br>
                mix hoke khade ho, senior ko wish karu, mera lick karo, yes daddy. <br>
                dance ke baad ciggy bhi offer kiya. Hmm, at this point im convinced that my future is doomed. Ab toh sure hai ki galat college me aagaya. aunty ki baat sun lena chahiye tha. Manish bhaiya phasa ke chale gaye. Ab agar mai chud gaya toh bachane ke liye bhi koi nahi. <br>

                No offence but i hate chai. At this point in india, enought people are aware about harm of tabacoo and shit. Addiction never goes away. hence now people are addicted to chai. Apparently chai doesn't have any side effects, so there's no one to stop people from drinking more chai than water. <br>
                To keep up with demand, the suppliers(chaiwala) cut cost by adding water and using cheap, non certified tea leafs. Just like in our mess. <br>
                Also, posting chai pic on internet is not fun, it's disgusting, atleast for me. <br><br>
                bc kar physics ka paper hai, fail horaha hu mai toh kal for sure.

                Kal RGPV, Bhopal gaye the Ecell ke robo comp. me. Waha Vidisha sunte hi woh alag treatment dene lega. ashu ne pucha ki deal kya hai SATI ka, unhone me bola ki kuch hua tha last time. Gussing ki senior ne kuch kand kiya hoga. <br><br>
                Aur wapis aane ke baat yt pe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yetendray/videos">yeh</a> channel mila, bro was making wireless bot when youtube didn't existed. Crazy innovation, woh bhi uss era me jab ai, youtube, esp32 kuch nahi tha, pure brainpower. This made us think, ki what when wrong, from being top insitute of state to fucking goon spot in 2025. <br>
                "<em class="blow">SATI's downfall need to studied</em>." - aashu <br>
                let me try to contact the owner of above yt channel, his number still looks valid, he should provide some better info on what went wrong with sati. Aashu says it's the IITfication of our country that took the best mind to IITs instead of them joining local state/city's insitute like SATI. This has to be a factor, because people with low rank are usually the people that were not studying, and gooning, which seeing the current status of SATI, proves to be true. And it's getting worst, atleast in my perspective.

                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/1l6d1ya/comment/mwnttbp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">This</a> is literally aul & zay. one second they were cracking rape jokes on my sister & next second when i did the same, they got fuming. it's been 2 week and neither of them have spoken a word to me. <br>
                Great! im enjoying my life without those two little sluts. I still remember when i have 1 month in SATI, my second top priority to improve my life was to distance from aul & zay(first priority always being to leave the college). I thought zay was great person at first, but i was wrong. Zay introduced me to aul, & my first inital though was not to friend him. Zay stayed with aul & so did I. I never said that I liked rahul, from his first looks I knew he's cap. <br>
                I showed a lot of oppotunities to them. Took them to Nagpur, indore and bhopal for competing, & everyone knows thier bot works today only because of me. Should have never done that. Mistake were made. Mistake are to be made. The only friends group i had during first year, bunch of whores desperate to get fucked. Hope my new roommate will last more than a year.
