                ngl, sometimes K.S. feels like he is just using us as a catapult. <br>
                I fear betrayal coming from his side soon. <br>
                The way he licks vedansh's ass, and then says seniors are bad. Something's for sure fissy. I can't read his mind, but his actions are sus, very sus.
                <br>
                <em class="context">Context: Vedansh, as a elected mentor & senior of AIADS batch, is organising a fresher party. &(apparently) is forcing us to pay the fees & attend it. Between all this, we had technovision25 at SATI, and he allegedly was supporting day scholar get qualified & making (us)hostler get eliminated. Including me, we too had a great fight with flux team. didn't knew vedansh was behind this. All of us hostler are now against vendash cum bucket, but koustubh is still licking. while most of our batch are making excuses to not attend freshers party, koustubh is going. Knowing how badly vedansh abused his floormates, one of them got seisures and was in hospital for few days.</em>
