                ngl, sometimes K.S. feels like he is just using us as a catapult. <br>
                I fear betrayal coming from his side soon. <br>
                The way he licks vedansh's ass, and then says seniors are bad. Something's for sure fissy. I can't read his mind, but his actions are sus, very sus.
                <br>
                <em class="context">Context: Vedansh, as a elected mentor & senior of AIADS batch, is organising a fresher party. &(apparently) is forcing us to pay the fees & attend it. Between all this, we had technovision25 at SATI, and he allegedly was supporting day scholar get qualified & making (us)hostler get eliminated. Including me, we too had a great fight with flux team. didn't knew vedansh was behind this. All of us hostler are now against vendash cum bucket, but koustubh is still licking. while most of our batch are making excuses to not attend freshers party, koustubh is going. Knowing how badly vedansh abused his floormates, one of them got seisures and was in hospital for few days.</em>

                Should be studying rn, but i'm better off writing this. <br>
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTech/s/qM8CMPpo5H">this</a>, i see india becoming north korea soon under bjp's rule. shit's so insecure, want access of every piece of data. <br>
                Thinking more about this, how we forgot R.G. Kar case in weeks, tell a lot about what mindset of people i/we are living with. Teasing females is so normalized, that even girls straight up asks for it(credits to... instagram). Some neighbor told be not go vidisha for uni, we were like fucj'em, we ball. people so shit here, walking in torn cloths here feels like i'm some rich frag. apart from that, how dangerous it is for females. no way i'm sending my sister in this college. All of seniors are like crazy dipped towards getting pussy, damn, how sexually deprived you have to be for this level of nichness. <br>
                shashi tharoor rightly said: in india it's ok to piss in public but not kiss in public.

                jaise aul bhul gaya hai usse uski (temporary)bandi kaise mili. hackathon me kon le gaya tha, aur volenteer kon banwaya. <br>
                say itna abusive hai, fir bhi poker face karke rizz kar leta hai. only issue is, i'm too nice/helpfull to people who in turn always ends up ditching me.

                had a program today, 24 of my batchmates went together to school in a bus and i(a true asshole) read chats of you know who. chetan choudhary is whom i'm looking for. apart from reading chat, this program was a great experience. isse miss karta toh fomo hota, lekin attend kar diya. <br>
                bus me solid vibes set hogaya tha. it was nice ki zay aur aul nahi the. full fun hua, uj bhai sezy ke sath. this also proves im in a wrong friend circle. <br>
                felt great teaching children, but again, i felt like my brain's clock speed throttles when i'm out of my safe space.
