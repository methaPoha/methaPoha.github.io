            <p>Welcome to SATI ig</p>
            <p>I used to live here, right here would be my study table. <br>
            so, how's the room? This is the biggest room in the hostel. Only issue is ventilation, this room has no windows like the other rooms. Plus in winters, not so in summers. </p>
            <p>Its still not clear to me if this hostel will be boy hostel or girl hostel, but i'll try to keep this page gender neutral. <br><img src="boysngirls.jpg" alt="comparision, comparision kills joy."></p>

            <p>I assume it's your first day here, new place, new vibes. Missing your parents? ofcourse you are, if you are not then it's a serious issue. Hoping you are not coming from kota, From kota to SATI, what a waste of money that must have been.</p>
            <p>btw, on side note, you still have time, you can still leave the college and get your money back. To me the college gives a typical government institute vibes, no study, no infra, no response from faculty. But the friends i made along the way, is what's keeping me from leaving this college.</p>
            <p>This page is made to lower your expectation. High expectation leads to big shocks, and that's not good for health. There is a reason why all of this exists, and it's for you. My brain as soon I go to sleep:<br> <img src="my brain.webp" alt="looking back at life"><br>Name of the game is history lessons, I teach history.</p>
            
            <p>This page is specifically made for the one who is sitting on this table. Hope this table is still in S17, and if you are reading this, drop me a mail at the address given at the bottom of this page. Just so i know, that someone was able to read this. There's more this, where i give random advice/views, you can find it at <!Add LINK!></p>

            <p>what all can i add here?
